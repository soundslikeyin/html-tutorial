        <p>Sangatsu is a band that combines games with music. <br> 
            After years of making music, they decided to make music that anyone can play.<br> 
            Using simple instruments or just everyday objects, they have created serene music with simple processes that can be followed easily</p>

        <p>They have produced numerous musical performance works that make use of their locations and<br>
            the performersâ€™ bodies, which have been shown in places such as Beijing, Berlin, Seoul and Taipei. <br>
            They have also collaborated frequently with performers from other genres, including Hikaru Fujii and the theater company chelfitsch.<br>

        <p>In January 2012, they declared that they would waive their copyright in all music released from then on, <br>
